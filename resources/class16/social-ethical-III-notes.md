# Notes on Social/Ethical class III: Social good in computing

The assigned reading turned out to be rather old and out-of-date -- a
blog post published in 2016. Some of the links were broken, and others
linked to organizations that are no longer active. The instructor
apologized for assigning a problematic reading, but also explained
that this was a good learning opportunity: we should always approach
any text skeptically, asking basic questions about when it was
written, who wrote it, what was their research process, and so on.

In any case, the overall theme of the reading remains valid. There are many opportunities to benefit society via a career in computing or computation.

The remainder of the session was real-time research and discussion of
open-source software. "Source" refers to *source code* -- that is,
computer programs written in a programming language. "Open" refers to
the fact that open-source software makes its source code available for
anyone to download, inspect, and alter. Open-source software is also
generally available for free. Sometimes it is known as FOSS (free
open-source software). Some FOSS projects have a humanitarian aspect
and these are known as HFOSS projects. All FOSS projects, whether
humanitarian or not, benefit society by providing free software. This
is one important positive impact of computing on our society.

In class we discussed five important open-source projects: the Linux
operating system, the MySQL database, the Apache web server, OpenMRS
(a medical records system), and OpenStreetMap (a database of maps and
associated software, similar to Google Maps).
