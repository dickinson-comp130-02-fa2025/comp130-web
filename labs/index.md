* [lab 2 instructions](lab02.docx)

    optional.
* [lab 3 instructions](lab03.docx)
  - grading policy: As announced during lab, the required content of
    the lab is question 1 and *part of* question 2. Specifically, for
    the lab to be considered complete, in question 2 you must
    produce a program that shows the 8 x 8 checkerboard, but it is not
    necessary to have the color pattern of the squares correct. It's
    fine to display all squares the same color. The grading will give
    a weight of 75% to question 1 and 25% to the required part of
    question 2.
